PictureIt - Kodi Visualization
==============================

[![License: GPL-2.0-or-later](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v2+-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)

PictureIt is supposed to make listening to music more elegant and less flashy.<br>
The idea is to take random images YOU selected and display them alongside a simple spectrum at the bottom.<br>
Simple right?

## Features
 * Select a local directory containing your images (If sub-folders are present, those will be used as "Preset")
 * Update images by interval
 * Update images on new track
 * Change the transition time
 * Enable/Disable the spectrum
 * Enable/Disable a settle spectrum-background
 * Change the spectrums: Width, Bottom-Padding, Animation-Speed

## Installation
 The addon is available for all OS by addon download inside Kodi, except Linux where related distribution need to bring it.
 To build yourself can be instructions found here https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/tree/master/docs.

## ToDo
 * Rework the spectrum.<br>
As of now it looks quite busy and doesn't match the music very well.<br>
